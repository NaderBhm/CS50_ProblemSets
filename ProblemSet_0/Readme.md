My Scratch project is the famous Snake game. It includes three sprites: 'Apple' (the food the snake eats), 'SNAKE' (the player-controlled snake), and 'announcer' (which handles messages). The project contains 56 blocks, where the user uses the keyboard arrows to control the snake. When the snake makes contact with the apple, it eats it, gaining 1 point in the score and increasing its speed slightly to add difficulty to the game.
